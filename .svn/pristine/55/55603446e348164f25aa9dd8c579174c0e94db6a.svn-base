README FOR FTIR BACKGROUND SUBTRACT TOOL 
Copyright Nial Peters & Kayla Iacovino, 2014

RUNNING THE SCRIPT: 
No need to install anything. Just make sure you have
the correct dependencies installed before running the script: 
Python 
wx
matplotlib 
pylab 
numpy

Navigate to the directory where bkgd_subtract.py is located. Type
"python bkgd_subtract.py" into a terminal. If you have all the
dependencies installed properly, it should run the program.


USING THE PROGRAM: 
Chose your file in the file chooser window. Your
spectrum file should be two columns with wavenumber and absorbances (see
the example file test-spectrum.CSV).

Use the red and green sliders to set the boundaries over which a
polynomial will be fit to your spectrum. Everything within the green
sliders will be included in the fit. Everything within the red sliders
will be excluded from the fit. The standard approach is to place the red
sliders just outside of the peak of interest and set the green sliders
to include as much background as possible corresponding to that peak.
Once you have chosen your slider positions, click "Apply". Clicking
apply will first find the limits set by your sliders and then calculate
a background polynomial. The polynomial will then be shown in the second
plot (blue points are points used in the fitting; red points are those
that could not be fit and were excluded from the fitting). The
background-subtracted portion of your spectrum will be shown in the
bottom plot. Hover your mouse over the peak to get the y-value.

The four buttons labelled "3500", "CO3", "4500", "5200", and "CO3 (2)"
will suggest placement of the sliders for various parts of the spectrum.
If using the suggested limits, do not click "Apply", which will read the
positions of the limits shown by the sliders. Instead use "Apply
suggested", which instead applies the values in the text boxes.

The "Get Limits" button will find the values of the sliders and put them
into the limit text boxes. Limits can also be typed in manually. You do
not need to click "Get Limits" before clicking "Apply".

The Fit Order is the order of the polynomial. We suggest using fit
orders from 1-5.
